= File naming

No matter what repo and directory structure you choose, directory and file names should be clear and consistent.

* Numbered file names like `52187.adoc` or `IMG_390.png` are more likely to cause confusion for other contributors.
* Short file names are good, as long as they're still meaningful.  But give enough detail to make the content clear (`overview.adoc` could be anything).
* Long file names are often unwieldy, hard to work with, and easy to mistype.  Try to find the right balance for file-name length.
* File names should reflect the topic they cover to help contributors find content in your files.
* Do not include the project or product name, book name, release version, or anything similar in file names.
* Do not hard-code file names when linking documents. Use relative paths to the topic or directory.
