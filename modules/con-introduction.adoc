This guide has been provided by https://www.redhat.com/[Red Hat^] to assist enterprise projects in collaborating with upstream communities on documentation. For Red Hat, this guide provides tips for evaluating a community to see if they are prepared for collaboration with an enterprise software team, communication guidelines, information about supported and unsupported tools, and guidelines for structuring git repositories.

In addition to recommendations for Red Hat documentation teams, this guide provides best practices, templates, and content recommendations to upstream communities. These suggestions inform communities on how to prepare for Red Hat writers to collaborate on documentation.
