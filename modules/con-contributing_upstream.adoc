= Contributing upstream

This is a set of guidelines for  getting involved in an upstream open source documentation project.
It is geared primarily towards people working for a downstream distributor,
although many of the guidelines are useful for everyone.

The first step to get involved is to join the conversation.
Open source teams communicate in many different ways, including mailing lists, IRC, Slack, and Telegram.
Find out where documentation conversations are happening and join.
For most projects, there is a documentation-specific mailing list.
Sometimes, there is just a single development mailing list that includes documentation work.
When you join a mailing list, it's a good idea to send an email introducing yourself.
Tell the team who you are and what ways you're interesting in helping.

When trying to introduce changes, it is important not to come across as judgmental or condescending.
An email that paints a team's work as wrong or broken will often be ignored,
or it will cause people to become very defensive.
Instead, point out the positive and try to show how it can be incrementally improved.

Be curious and show that you're listening.
If there's something you don't think is optimal, try to understand why it is the way it is.
"This isn't the right way to do things" rarely effects positive change.
"I'm trying to understand why we do things this way" is a better way of sparking constructive conversation.

You may have specific ideas of how you want to improve something, but when working with the community,
you have to be prepared to adapt your ideas to what others are saying.
Every project has unique objectives, constraints, history, and culture. One size rarely fits all.

When proposing changes, focus on how they will benefit the project and the community,
rather than how they will benefit you or your employer.
Commercial distributions have business needs, and these affect what they would like to see in upstream projects.
But their business needs aren't necessarily interesting or relevant to the project.

Proposals to change things carry more weight when somebody is offering to do the work.
You may have heard responses like "show me the code" or "patches welcome".
If you want something improved, show that you're willing to put in some of the work.
If you're not sure how you can best help, ask the community.
"How can I help?" is a great question.
If it involves technical work you're not comfortable with, find somebody who can help.

Sometimes it can be difficult for a newcomer to propose new ideas in an established community.
If you're uncomfortable, or if you're not making progress,
try to find somebody more established in the community to talk to.
Remember that the same advice applies when talking to an individual.
Be positive and curious. Listen and understand. Offer to help.

Finally, be prepared to accept that things will not always go the way you want.
One of the defining characteristics of a community is that it makes its own decisions.
That's the reality of being good open source citizens.
