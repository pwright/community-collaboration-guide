= Synchronizing content

Copy the changes in one repository to another using the batch commit method.

.Prerequisites

* Given that you already have a batch commit script, `fetch-upstream.sh`, the workflow for synchronizing content from the upstream repository is as follows:

.Procedure
. Pull down the latest content from the upstream repository and put the downloaded files in the `upstream/` subdirectory:
+
----
$ ./fetch-upstream.sh
----

. Inspect the downloaded content (for example, using `git diff`) to check for new files, restructured content, and so on.
If necessary, edit the book file, `master.adoc`, to incorporate new content.

. Add and commit the downloaded content:
+
----
$ git add upstream
$ git commit -m "Synched content from upstream"
----
