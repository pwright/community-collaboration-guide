GitBook is a documentation hosting system based on GitHub.

Website: link:https://www.gitbook.com[https://www.gitbook.com^]

Advantages::
* Very low barrier to entry for community members
** Easy to make edits
** Comes with a built-in stylesheet
* Publishes in AsciiDoc
* Integrates into GitHub
* Allows inline comments
* Supports building books written in multiple languages
** Each language is in a subdirectory
** Support for rtl languages
* Includes a full-text search engine
** JSON index file on a static version of the documentation

Challenges::
* Having to review inline comments is time consuming when you are also monitoring issue tracking systems
* Converting to downstream requires a Python script
* Requires a lengthy process to pull content from GitBook to the downstream
* Directory tree defined by GitBook and does not allow for easy manipulation
* Only free for a small number of managers, has a cost after that
* Things that work in AsciiDoc do not always work in GitBook
** Certain special tags will completely break things in GitBook
** AsciiDoc is not fully supported in GitBook
* GitBook requires that we use a JSON file for attributes which is not as flexible as AsciiDoc
** You can embed attributes in AsciiDoc, but not in JSON
* GitBook support is ad-hoc
* Edits are immediately committed
* Editor is not advanced enough to keep in conditional tags in place
